cpd v0.2.0 includes some new features and a decent amount of reorganization.
Very little has changed in the inner working of the algorithms, however.
For a complete list of changes, please see CHANGES.md or `git log v0.1.1..v0.2.0`.
Here's a summary of the more significant changes:

- Bump the required CMake version up to 2.8.12
- Add cmake configuration scripts to allow easy(er) downstream project integration â€” see example/ in the main source tree for a demo integration.
- `Registration::operator()` was renamed to `Registration::run`
- Defaults were changed from UPPER_CASE to CamelCase
- `SpResult` was renamed to `ResultPtr`
- The `Normalization` and `Result` structs were moved into the `Registration` class
- The sigma2 parameter can be tweaked a bit more to improve performance and accuracy
