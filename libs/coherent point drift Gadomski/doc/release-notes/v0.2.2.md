Version v0.2.2 provides a fix for rpath settings that broke executable installation when installing with a non-system CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
Since Ubuntu doesn't search /usr/local/lib for shared libraries by default, our default installation on Ubuntu was broken.
This version also incorporates a few other non-library improvements, including the addition of a Vagrantfile for easy Ubuntu setup on unfriendly hosts (here's looking at you, Windoze users) and consolation of some of our basic workflows down to simple makefiles.
